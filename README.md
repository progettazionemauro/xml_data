# xml_data
Example to import data in javascript
There are many, many ways to pull in XML data, to be shown on a web page. Here I'll take a look at the client-side solution. One that uses the popular framework, JQuery. In this example, we're going to incorporate XML data to show four paintings in an online exhibition. You see the final file here. On the screen the data will include the file names of the images as well as text content for the painting slides, artists and costs. So let's look at the XML file that holds that data.
As you can see the root element is paintings. That starts on line two. And there are four separate painting nodes. This makes up one painting node, from line three to line eight. In each of those, is the title of the painting, the artist, which is the same for all four nodes, the image file name, and the price. You may notice that the file name doesn't contain any path information. That's to keep the data flexible. Likewise the price has no dollar sign.
